        "\n",
        "Node.js uses a single-threaded, event-driven architecture built on top of Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv, a library that provides asynchronous I/O.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the core, Node.js follows the \"non-blocking I/O\" model and operates on a \"single-threaded event loop\" to handle multiple client requests efficiently without creating multiple threads.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.Single-Threaded, Event-Driven Model:\n",
        "\n",
        "In traditional server architectures (like Apache), each incoming request is handled by a separate thread, leading to high memory and CPU usage when handling many concurrent users.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, Node.js handles all requests using a single thread. It uses an event loop that listens for events (like incoming HTTP requests, file reads, etc.) and delegates blocking operations (e.g., disk or network I/O) to worker threads in the background (thread pool).\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s how it works:\n",
        "\n",
        "Client sends a request (e.g., read a file).\n",
        "\n",
        "Node.js receives the request on the main thread.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the request is non-blocking, it is processed directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the request is blocking (like file system or database access), Node.js delegates it to worker threads using the libuv library.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the worker finishes, the result is passed back to the main thread via a callback or promise, and the event loop continues.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Why This Architecture is Suitable for I/O-Heavy Applications:\n",
        "\n",
        "No Blocking: Since Node.js doesn't block the main thread on I/O operations, it can handle thousands of simultaneous requests.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scalability: The event-driven model scales very well for real-time apps, APIs, and microservices.\n",
        "\n",
        "Low Resource Usage: Unlike multi-threaded servers, Node.js doesn't spawn a new thread per request, making it memory-efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "Best for I/O: Applications that rely heavily on disk or network access (e.g., web servers, chat apps, streaming services, etc.) benefit the most.\n",
